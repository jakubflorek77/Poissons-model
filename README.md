# Poissons-model
Runs Poissons modelling and Kelly criterion optimal bet stake calculation. Uses files with statistics &amp; odds generated in the other project
Edit: 4 spreadsheets (1x stats, 2x bookmakers odds, 1x team names matching sheet) have been added.
These sheets have been generated using my scripts from "understat_beftfair_scrap" project.
Personally, I do process this data in an Excel spreadsheet, as it gives a better control over data and it is easier to understand that the code uploaded here.
